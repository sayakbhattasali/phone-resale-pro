## ✨ Overview

Phone Resale Pro helps users instantly estimate the resale value of used smartphones in the Indian market.

Instead of manually guessing prices, the platform uses a trained ML model and multiple real-world factors such as age, battery health, RAM, storage, condition, and original launch price to generate a smart valuation.

This project was upgraded using a cleaned dataset, realistic phone variants, and retrained ML models for stronger accuracy and better market realism.
